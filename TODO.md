# down the line:
it works fine without these, however these would be nicer to have in events rather than through the packetlistener 
## move to events:
- [ ] chunk/mapchunkbulk
- [ ] entity spawns and interaction (not move though, that has to be done with packets)
- [ ] block packets
- [ ] collect packets
- [ ] vehicle/attach_entity packets
- [ ] block_break_animation
